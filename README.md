## Configuring AWS access

The easiest way to configure AWS Cloud access is to run [`aws configure`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration) which will prompt you for the setup.

Also you can create the configure your **$HOME/.aws/credentials** file as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html):

## Configuring OCI access

Configuring OCI console is done in a similar way like the AWS one by running [`oci setup config`](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm). Variables configured in the **$HOME/.oci/config** must be the following in order for the terraform environment to be successfully configured:
* user (with ocid value)
* tenancy (with ocid value)
* compartment (with ocid value)
* fingerprint
* key_file (with key path)
* region
